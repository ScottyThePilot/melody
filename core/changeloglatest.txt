This is the version I started doing changelogs on. Previous changelogs may not be available.
**Added:**
- New command: `changelog`. This will send you the latest changelog entry.
- General Message Logging - All servers who previously had `logMessages` enabled now have `logMessageChanges` and `logMessages` enabled. (Read more below)
**Changed:**
- Feedback now works, and is enabled.
- `logMessages` now logs all send messages, instead of logging edits and deletions.
- `logMessageChanges` now does what `logMessages` previously did. (log edits and deletions)
